[Barista](https://barista.dynatrace.com) is the name of
[Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com)'s design system, that contains all
ingredients to create extraordinary user experiences. Like a barista picks the
best ingredients for their coffee – and we love coffee!

One major part of the Barista design system is our
[components library](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/barista/tree/master/libs/barista-components)
written in Angular.
